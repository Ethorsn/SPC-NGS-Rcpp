Here, we introduce the necessary notation for this thesis. Let $y^{(m)}_{t,i,j,k,l}$ represent a observation from the lowest level of observations, the tag level. The superscript $(m)$ represents which variable we are referring to. The support of any given variable $y^{(m)}_.$. The subscripts are defined as follows;
\begin{itemize}
\item $t$ represents the date which the run was performed
\item $i=1,2,...$ represents the $i'$th flowcell  
\item $j=1,2,...,8$ represents the lane number
\item $k=1,2$ the read number
\item $l=1,2,..$ represent the tag sequence searched for
\end{itemize}

$i=1,2,3,...,N$ represents the flowcell and the order of the runs, $j=1,2,...,8$ represents the lane number, $k=1,2$ the read number and last $l=1,2,..$ represent the tag sequence searched for. In vector notation, we will write $\mathbf{y}^{(m)}_{t,i,j,k}=(y^{(m)}_{t,i,j,k,1},y^{(m)}_{t,i,j,k,2},...)^T$, where $T$ is the transpose.

Let $\mathbf{X}_i$, $i=1,2,3,...$ represent a multivariate sequential process. Each  
 The super- and subscripts have the same representation as before. Note that we have lost the subscript $l$ since there only exists one observation from each read and lane at this level.
